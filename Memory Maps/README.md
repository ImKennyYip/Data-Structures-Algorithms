# Memory Map Images
In this section, we draw memory map images to illustrate what is happening in memory (call stack and heap) as we execute our code line by line. 

## Topics Include:
* Variable Assignments and Swapping
* Strings and Lists
* For Loops
* Functions
* Shallow Copy vs Deep Copy
* List Slice and Multiply
